# Detection Lab

## Objective

This Detection Lab project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Managment (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practial application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced Knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity
  
### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Managment (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network Analysis tools (such as wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realisitic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
(drag & drop screenshots here) (Screenshots need additional explaination of what steps I took underneath)


## 1. Setting up applications in VirtualboxVM  8/13/2025 
I am going to be using Kali linux as an attack simulator on a virtual machine.
